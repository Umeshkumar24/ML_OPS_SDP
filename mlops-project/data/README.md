# This file provides documentation about the data structure and contents.

## Data Directory Structure

The `data` directory contains two main subdirectories:

1. **raw**: This directory will contain the raw data files used for the project. These files are the original datasets that have not been modified or processed in any way.

2. **processed**: This directory will hold the processed data files after cleaning and transformation. These files are ready for analysis and modeling.

## Data Usage

- Ensure that raw data files are placed in the `data/raw` directory.
- After processing the raw data, save the cleaned and transformed files in the `data/processed` directory.
- Document any changes made to the data in this README to maintain a clear record of data transformations.
