# MLOps Project

This project is designed to implement a machine learning pipeline for data processing, model training, and evaluation. It follows best practices in MLOps to ensure reproducibility and maintainability.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains raw and processed data files.
  - **raw/**: Directory for raw data files.
  - **processed/**: Directory for processed data files.
  - **README.md**: Documentation about the data structure and contents.

- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for analysis.
  - **exploratory_analysis.ipynb**: Notebook for exploratory data analysis.

- **src/**: Source code for the project.
  - **pipelines/**: Contains the pipeline workflow implementation.
    - **__init__.py**: Marks the pipelines directory as a Python package.
    - **pipeline.py**: Implementation of the pipeline workflow.
  - **models/**: Contains the machine learning model definitions.
    - **__init__.py**: Marks the models directory as a Python package.
    - **model.py**: Defines the machine learning model.
  - **utils/**: Contains utility functions.
    - **__init__.py**: Marks the utils directory as a Python package.
    - **helpers.py**: Utility functions for data processing and evaluation.
  - **__init__.py**: Marks the src directory as a Python package.

- **tests/**: Contains unit tests for the project.
  - **test_pipeline.py**: Unit tests for the pipeline workflow.
  - **test_model.py**: Unit tests for the model.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project.

- **setup.py**: Used for packaging the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the pipeline using the provided scripts in the `src/pipelines` directory.

## Usage Guidelines

- Use the Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks` directory for exploratory data analysis.
- Modify the pipeline and model scripts in the `src` directory as needed for your specific use case.
- Ensure to run the tests in the `tests` directory to validate your changes.
